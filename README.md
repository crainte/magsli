Provides an endpoint for MailGun's webhooks which will format and send messages to a Slack webhook.

Use Case
---
I host four containerized WordPress sites that each use MailGun for sending email. Occasionally I get a customer who cannot receive email this way (their systems reject it), but MailGun doesn't notify me that delivery failed. I wanted an alert so I can go look at the logs to see what's happening and contact the customer directly.

Design Goals
--
This was designed to solve a particular problem: _How do I receive a notification in Slack for any errors that happen when MailGun is delivering mail?_

As far as I can tell there's no way to receive notification of errors other than webhooks, and there isn't an official integration with Slack anywhere. I did find [SlackGun](https://github.com/slickplaid/node-slack-mailgun), but it doesn't meet my needs.

I wanted this to be:

- small &amp; simple
- designed for a docker container
- low maintenance
- self contained (no vendoring/external libraries)

Building
--
I have included a Makefile that builds both a macOS and a statically linked Linux version, so you can use `make` to build both or `make macos` and `make linux` to build them individually.

I cross-compile it on macOS to create a static build that I just drop into a container on my Digital Ocean droplet (Ubuntu).

Usage
--
It's meant to be used in a container, so the interface is quite minimal. When it is run, magsli will look for the following environment variables:

- **MAILGUN_API_KEY** - your MailGun private API key  
- **SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL** - the URL of your Slack webhook to posting to
- **SERVER_SSL_CERT_FILE** - path to your server's SSL certificate file
- **SERVER_SSL_KEY_FILE** - path to your server's SSL private key file

Example for docker-compose:
```
  magsli:
    ...
    environment:
      MAILGUN_API_KEY: key-<long hex number> (which probably comes from your .env file)
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/<long random text>
      SERVER_SSL_CERT_FILE: "/etc/nginx/certs/<domain name>.crt"
      SERVER_SSL_KEY_FILE: "/etc/nginx/certs/<domain name>.key"
```

These options may also be specified on the command line:
```
Usage: ./magsli [options]
Options:
  -mailgun string
    	MailGun API Key
  -slack string
    	Slack webhook to post to
  -sslCert string
    	Path to server certificate file
  -sslKey string
    	Path to server private key file
```

However you choose to deploy **magsli**, once you have a URL for the service (e.g. https://foo.com/magsli), you can simply set it as the URL in the MailGun webhook settings for each event you want to be notified on.

FAQ
--
**What does a message look like?**

![Notification Example](./images/example.png)

**This could be useful to me, but it doesn't do/show "X". Can you make it do/show "X"?**

I probably could, but I probably won't if "X" breaks any of my design goals. Please submit a GitHub issue and we can discuss it keeping in mind that one of the main design goals of this project is small &amp; simple (see above).

I would suggest if you need customizability that you fork this repo and make your changes. (If you release your fork publicly, please change the name to avoid confusion.)

**I found a bug. Will you fix bugs?**

Absolutely! Please submit an issue and we can work through it.

**What's with the weird code to get the email subject from the MailGun POST?**

The `message-headers` field from MailGun, while technically JSON, is in a bizarre developer-hostile format :-)

It's an array of string arrays for key/value pairs like this:
```
[
...
  ["Subject", "Test bounces webhook"],
  ["From", "Bob <bob@foo.com>"]
...
]
```
So it can't be marshalled easily as JSON to provide convenient indexing. I just use a very generic `[]interface{}` and index/cast to the correct thing.
  
It's a bit of a hack. If there's a simple, more elegant way to do this, please submit an issue.

**What's the license?**

There is no license. Not everything needs to be owned by someone. Do whatever you want with it.
